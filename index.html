      <h3>Salary</h3>
      <p>In some situations Full stack developers get good pay as they know both the front end and back end of the web applications. And there are also situations where Backend engineers earn a good pay than full stack developers. It depends on several factors but it is a good choice. It is always good to be a full stack developer, but specialise On one side because when big tech companies  lets say like Google hire you, they hire you as a either a frontend dev or backend dev, not a full stack developer as specialisation is a good principal. But it is a personal decision.Here you'll find anything you want to know <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search?query=full%20stack%20dev" target="_blank">about FSD.</a></p>
